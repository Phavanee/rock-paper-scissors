# rock-paper-scissors
this is another project under top - to create a rock paper scissors game to practice javascript logic and problem solving skills    
    
this rock paper scissors game will be played entirely in the console - but we'll come back to refurbish this and add a gui when we have the time    

## goals
- learn to write logic in javascript
- practice debugging in the console
- harden my brain to learn new things ðŸ’»
